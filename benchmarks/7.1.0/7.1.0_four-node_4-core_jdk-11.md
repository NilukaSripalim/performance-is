# IAM Performance Test Results

During each release, we execute various automated performance test scenarios and publish the results.
This document will be helpful for capacity planning as it reflects realistic user scenarios.

Our test client is [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/index.html). We test each scenario for a fixed duration of
time and split the test results into warm-up and measurement parts and use the measurement part to compute the
performance metrics. For this particular instance, the duration of each test is **15 minutes** and the warm-up period is **5 minutes**.

We run the performance tests under different numbers of concurrent users and heap sizes to gain a better understanding on how the server reacts to different loads.

The main performance metrics:

1. **Response Time**: The end-to-end latency for a given operation of the WSO2 Identity Server. The complete distribution of response times was recorded.

The following are the test specifications.
